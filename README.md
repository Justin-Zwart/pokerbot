Josiah is currently going through [this tutorial](https://dev.to/koladev/building-a-fullstack-application-with-django-django-rest-nextjs-3e26) setting up [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Get Started

These instructions assume you are on a Windows computer.

1. Ensure `python 3.11` or later is installed.
2. From the root directory run the following commands.

```bash
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate
```

3. Install Django and the other necessary packages.

```bash
pip install django djangorestframework
# @Justin-Zwart put your other pip-installs here :)
```

If your VS Code isn't detecting your installs, follow [these instructions](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66869413/visual-studio-code-does-not-detect-virtual-environments).
